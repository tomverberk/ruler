This is the readme file for the puzzle game.

Source files of this game can be found in unity -> Assets -> Scripts -> puzzle.
And include a puzzleController, and 4 UI files. These UI files are not yet in there precize form but a simple cutout.
The UI files are the following
- Polygon, which will describe the created polygon
- PolygonPoints, which will describe points as part of the polygon
- Triangles, Which will describe the triangle created by the triangulation
- polygonEdges, which will describe the edges of the polygon
- (triangulation) we are not sure if we will make this an seperate file but if we do it will contain the triangulation




The game can be accessed by going to unity -> assets -> puzzle -> scenes 
and looking at the puzzlemenu scene.

We are not yet implementing any game figures as our application differs to much from the example application.
